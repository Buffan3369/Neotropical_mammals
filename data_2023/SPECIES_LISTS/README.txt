This folder contains fossil occurrences datasets with different stages of cleaning/time matching:

	- 1-Raw_Cnz_SA_Mammals_occurrences.csv : Raw South American Mammal occurrences downloaded from PBDB on the 03/23/2023
	- 2-Matched_Uncleaned_Cnz_SA_Mammals.csv: Raw occurrences with age range reassigned to time boundaries of the corresponding interval indicated in PBDB (both ICC and SALMA)
	- 3-Fully_cleanes_SALMA_kept.csv: Fully Cnz cleaned occurrences (no SALMA extension) (only new EOT taxa added!!)
	- 4-Fully_cleaned_and_SALMA_matched_Cnz_SA_Mammals.csv : Fully cleaned Cenozoic species list with extended SALMA, i.e, occurrences associated to a SALMA re-assigned to the ICC stage which they most overlapped with
	- 5-Fully_cleaned_and_SALMA_matched_EOT_SA_Mammals.csv : Same as 3 but only keeping occurrences included in the Eocene-Oligocene interval
	- 6-Fully_cleaned_EOT_SA_Mammals.csv: Same as 4 but without matching occurrences associated to a SALMA to their corresponding ICC stage

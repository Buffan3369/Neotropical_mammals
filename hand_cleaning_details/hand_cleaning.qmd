*Equus sp.* (coll. nb. 142158 and 142160, [@coltorti2007]) were both set to *Equus (Amerhippus)*.   
*Equus asinus* (coll. nb. 190844, [@steadman1986]) was removed as introduced by humans.  
*Equus caballus* (coll. nb. 63337, [@deschamps2005]) was set *Equus (Amerhippus) neogeus* by Alberdi and Prado (1992) [@alberdi1992].  
*Equus caballus* (coll. nb. 70704, [@marshall1991]) time range was set to Holocene.  
*Equus caballus* (coll. nb. 142016, [@boule1920]) was set to *Equus (Amerhippus) insulatus*.  
*Equus caballus* (coll. nb. 73842, [@oliver1935]) time range was set to Pleistocene by [@canto2010].  
*Equus santaeelenae* (coll. nb. 144922, 145506, [@pujos2004]) time ranges were adjusted to Late Pleistocene.  
*Hippidium (Plagiohippus)* (coll. nb. 71304, [@reig1957]) name was set to *Hippidion* [@alberdi1992].  
*Hypohippidium humahuaquense* (coll. nb. 210722, [@de1957]) was synonimised with *Hippidion devillei* by [@alberdi1992]

*Tapirus (Tapilarum)* (coll. nb. 53928, [@rusconi1934]) name was shortened to *Tapirus*, and age set to Early Pleistocene.  
*Tapirus tarijensis* (coll. nb. 70673, [@marshall1991]) lower age boundary was set to 1.06 Ma.

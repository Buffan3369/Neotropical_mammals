## 1. Extended Materials and methods
### Fossil data compilation

We first downloaded all Cenozoic mammal occurrences at least with a genus-level resolution from South America from The Paleobiology Database (`?base_name=Mammalia&taxo_reso=genus&cc=SOA`) on 2023-12-11 (n=10,440 occurrences).
Because diversification regimes do not occur in the same way on land and in the sea @scholl_diversification_2016, and because the scope of this paper is terrestrial, we removed taxa with marine affinities, *i.e*., occurrences assigned to the orders “Cetacea” and “Sirenia” or the families “Otariidae” and “Phocidae” (n=354 occurrences).
Subsequently, as ref. @tarquini_multicausal_2022 performed an intensive cleaning of a significant proportion of South American mammalian fossil occurrences (especially Sparassodonts and Native Ungulates), we matched the time ranges of the occurrences we shared with them to those that they proposed (n=2,998 occurrences).
For the remaining occurrences, we ensured that their time ranges matched the boundaries of their associated interval.
For instance, the Mustersan occurrences were all found to be associated with the 48--42 Ma interval.
However, radiochronological evidence has shown that this age is younger, constraining its boundaries to 38.2--35 Ma (conservative estimates have even constrained it to 38.2--38 Ma, based on the only clear datations from well-defined levels) @dunn_new_2013 (**Fig. S1**).
It is quite concerning to see that such major changes remain uncorrected, especially in public encyclopedies, often used as primary sources of information for non-specialists (*e.g*., <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustersan>).
Age boundaries were expressed as either an International Chronostratigraphic Chart (ICC) stage/epoch or a South American Land Mammal Age (SALMA).
In the latter case, we used a SALMA scale built de-novo based on a literature review [*e.g*., @kouvari_palaeoenvironmental_2023].
Then, based on the literature and the expertise of the co-authors, we manually revised the entire dataset, occurrence by occurrence.
This “manual cleaning” aimed at correcting errors in the database, mostly regarding the age range and the taxonomic assignment (*e.g*., synonymized genus names, typos, missing elements of open nomenclature) of each occurrence (**Fig. S2**).
We intended to make this step as clear as possible by documenting most of the changes we made, and why (*see Manual Occurrence Cleaning part*).
Finally, in order to decrease the number of parameters to estimate, we restricted our dataset to the late Paleocene-Early Miocene (60--16 Ma).
The final dataset comprised 3,384 occurrences, including 529 genera and 1,108 identified species (see **Tab. S1** for a more detailed description of the data). Occurrence data can be found at <https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26495989>.

### Further input treatments

Subsequent data manipulation and visualization were carried out using the Tidyverse @wickham_welcome_2019 suite of R packages, the paleoverse @jones_palaeoverse_2023 and the deeptime @gearty_deeptime_2023 R packages.
Out of 3,384 occurrences, 2,108 occurrences (representing *approx.* 62% of the total) were assigned to a SALMA.
Due to temporal gaps in the South American Mammal fossil record this timescale is not continuous (**Fig. S1**).
Yet, gaps can highly bias fossil-based diversification inferences, as, for instance, shown in insects @jouault_estimating_2022.
Therefore, we decided to assign sub-epoch ages to the SALMA-associated occurrences (**Fig. S1-2**), ensuring ourselves to sample the whole study period more evenly.
As illustrated by many studies [@condamine_climate_2019; @tarquini_multicausal_2022], the taxonomic scale impacts fossil-derived diversification patterns.
Defining species in the fossil record is difficult and prone to debate, and working at the species scale is particularly sensitive to biases such as synonymy or missing open literature elements (*e.g*., ‘cf.’, ‘aff.’, etc.).
Therefore, we analyzed our mammalian fossil database both at the genus and species levels (**Fig. S2**), but privileged the genus scale for our macroevolutionary conclusions.
We further applied several treatments to our data.
First, we tested the effect of removing singletons because our genus-level and species-level occurrence datasets comprise 36% and 54% of singletons, respectively (*i.e*., taxa only represented by a single occurrence in the entire dataset; **Tab. S1**).
It is worth noting that including singletons in diversification inferences is still under debate [@guinot_global_2023; @fitzgerald_examining_2006; @foote_origination_2000].
Also, PyRate was validated using simulated data with a proportion of singletons that, to our knowledge, never exceeded 34% @silvestro_improved_2019.
Hence, we possibly ignore how the model might behave with such high proportions of singletons as those we have, though it was found to be robust against data incompleteness.
Second, we did not allow a given genus (or species) to have geographically and temporally-identical occurrences (as done by ref. @guinot_global_2023).
Next, in order to have a better view on the different tempos of diversification between tropical and extratropical biomes, we assigned each occurrence a tropical or extratropical affinity.
Traditionally – both when dealing with extant or fossil lineages – such a geographic splitting is made by defining a latitudinal threshold above (or under, depending on the hemisphere) which occurrences are considered tropical.
The latter is commonly set as -23.4° in latitude, but sometimes also -23°, -23.5° or even -30°.
However, such a threshold is unsatisfactory, mainly because it does not consider tropics’ expansions and contractions through geological times (see refs. [@quintero_build-up_2023; @s_meseguer_ancient_2020] for a discussion on the topic).
Therefore, based on their middle age, we binned our occurrences into 5-Myr time bins and reconstructed their paleocoordinates (using the mid age of the bin as reconstruction age) with the PALEOMAP Global Plate Model @scotese_paleomap_2018.
Paleorotations were produced via an access to the GPlates Web Service (<https://gwsdoc.gplates.org/>) API implemented in the `paleorotate` function of the paleoverse R package @jones_palaeoverse_2023. Then, to assign them a tropical/extratropical affinity, we overlaid these point data with Köppen-Geiger paleoclimate zones produced every 5 My [@quintero_build-up_2023; @scotese_phanerozoic_2021].
Finally, our fossil occurrence data came with “diet” assignments, derived from dental ecomorphotypes, which we further revised and collapsed to only keep four different classes: carnivorous, herbivorous, insectivorous, and omnivorous.

### Bayesian inference of diversification accounting for preservation

We used the Bayesian framework of fossil-based diversity and diversification inference accounting for preservation implemented in PyRate v.3 [@silvestro_bayesian_2014; @silvestro_pyrate_2014].
Relying on birth-death and preservation processes, PyRate jointly estimates the times of origination and extinction and the preservation rate of each taxon, as well as the origination and extinction rates of the underlying birth-death process.
We approximated the posterior distribution of each parameter through Reversible-Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) @silvestro_improved_2019.
The RJMCMC algorithm provides an objective estimate of the number of diversification rate shifts, but empirical case studies found that it could also be sensitive to gaps in the fossil record @jouault_estimating_2022.
Hence, we also analyzed our fossil dataset under a Birth-Death model with Constrained rate Shifts (BDCS) @silvestro_revisiting_2015.
In the BDCS model, origination and extinction rates can only vary in a piecewise-constant way between a predefined set of time bins.
Given the temporal heterogeneity of our data (**Fig. S1** and **S4**), this framework was particularly relevant to us because the BDCS model can smooth rates through time when rates are very different within a bin due to preservation issues.
We both tested geological stages and 5 My-long intervals as input bins.
To achieve convergence, when working with full datasets, we ran 50,000,000 iterations at the genus level and 100,000,000 iterations at the species level, and sampled every 50,000.
When working with taxonomically- or diet-specific datasets, we ran 20,000,000 iterations, sampling every 20,000.
For each tested condition, we ran PyRate on 10 or 20 datasets of independently-sampled ages and retained those of which the majority of the parameters (posterior above all) converged.
Parameters were considered convergent when their Effective Sample Size (ESS) was above 200.
Convergence checks were assessed thanks to the PyMC 5.9.2 python library @wiecki_pymc-devspymc_2023.
For each set of runs, burn-in value was specified in an automatized pipeline as the value maximizing the ESS of the parameters (choosing between 1%, 5%, 10%, 25% and 50% of the posterior distribution), rather than using the same fixed value every time.
Parallel computing was made possible thanks to the parallel software @tange_gnu_2023.
In the RJMCMC analyses, we allowed for a minimal time window between two origination/extinction rate shifts of 1 My (`-mindt 1`).
We also allowed for preservation rate heterogeneity across taxa (`-mG`) as it is more realistic to consider uneven preservations across lineages (some lineages undergo better preservation than others).
We set Gamma priors of shapes 1.1 (default value) and model-estimated rates for both origination and extinction rates (`-pL 1.1 0` and `-pM 1.1 0` options).
The preservation rate prior was also sampled in a Gamma distribution of model-estimated rate, but we put a slightly larger shape (`-pP 2 0`), offering more flexibility @guinot_global_2023.
We assessed the most suitable preservation model for our data using the maximum-likelihood based model selection test included in PyRate (`-PPmodeltest` option), which resulted in favor of the Time-dependent Preservation Process (TPP) model allowing rate shifts between every geological stage (**Fig. S5-S6**).
Last, we tested for the sensitivity of our analyses to singleton removal (`-singleton 1` option) (**Fig. S12-S13**).
As the BDCS model takes longer to run than the RJMCMC model, we ran the former directly based on the origination and extinction times (respectively $Ts$ and $Te$) table estimated with the latter (`-d` option).
In fact, the joint estimation of $Ts$, $Te$ and the preservation process is the same between both models.
What changes is the diversification (birth-death) model they fit to the reconstructed diversity to assess the origination and extinction rates through time ($\lambda$ and $\mu$, respectively).
BDCS models were run across 10,000,000 iterations, sampling every 10,000. All subsequent analyses were performed in R v4.4.0 @R_citation.

### Age-Dependent Extinction

To assess the effect of taxon age on its extinction probability, we fitted the Age-Dependent Extinction (ADE) model to our data (`-ADE 1` option in PyRate) @hagen_estimating_2018.
This model assumes that taxon extinction probability is only a function of its age, and fits a Weibull probability density to the extinction rate de-novo estimated from occurrence data.
The presence (or not) of an ADE in our data is given by the value of the shape ($\phi$) parameter of the Weibull function: if $\phi>1$, extinction probability increases with taxon age; if $\phi<1$ extinction probability decreases with taxon age; and if $\phi=1$, no ADE can be characterized.
In practice, we consider that the shape parameter significantly differs from one when one is not included in its 95% HPD.
We ensured to fit this model within time windows with a relatively constant extinction rate.
As we only retrieved one significant shift in extinction rate around 39 Ma (**Fig 1** and **S8-11**), we therefore investigated the effect of the ADE between 56 and 39 Ma, and between 39 and 23.03 Ma (`-filter` option) (**Fig S41**).
Just like in the previous section, we set a time-variable preservation process (`-qShift` option) and allowed for preservation rate heterogeneity across taxa (`-mG` option).
We ran the model for 40 million MCMC generations and sampled every 40,000 iterations.
Parameters were considered convergent when their ESS was above 200.
Convergence checks were achieved using the PyMC3 python library @wiecki_pymc-devspymc_2023.

### Dissimilarity across time among faunal assemblages

To quantify the extent to which our successive faunal assemblages differed from one another, both in terms of taxonomic and trophic composition, we computed two commonly-used dissimilarity indices to compare ecological communities.
We used Jaccard's similarity index to compare the taxonomic composition of the five main mammal subdivisions we defined (notoungulates, other native ungulates, rodents, xenarthrans, and metatherians).
Considering $n(E)$ and $n(O)$ the total number of taxa within Eocene and Oligocene faunas, respectively, and $n(E \cap O)$ the number of shared taxa between both assemblages, this index is simply expressed as: $$J = \frac{n(E \cap O)}{n(E)n(O)}$$ This index is very intuitive and does not require any knowledge about the abundance of each taxon within both communities.
It ranges from zero to one, and the closer it gets to one, the more similar the two assemblages compared are.
Conversely, we compared sub-epoch-level functional compositions of the mammal assemblages by using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index, accounting for variations in relative abundance among the four trophic classes we defined based on dental ecomorphotypes (carnivorous, herbivorous, omnivorous, and insectivorous).
Considering two assemblages $A$ and $B$, $p$ classes (here, $p=4$), and $n(A,i)$ and $n(B,i)$ the respective numbers of taxa belonging to the class $i$ within the assemblages $A$ and $B$, this index is expressed as: $$BC = 1- \frac{2\sum^p_{i=1}min(n(A, i), n(B, i))}{\sum^p_{i=1}(n(A, i) + n(B, i))}$$ It also ranges from zero to one, but in that case, values closer to one indicate increasingly dissimilar assemblages.

### Multivariate Birth Death (MBD) model and Selection of environmental variables

To assess the impact of environmental factors on the diversification patterns of SAMs during the EOT, we ran a Multivariate Birth-Death (MBD) model in PyRate @lehtonen_environmentally_2017.
This model carries out two independent correlations involving a set of environmental covariates (that can be biotic and/or abiotic) and diversification rates newly-estimated from empirical $T_s$ and $T_e$: one with the origination rate ($\lambda$), and the other with the extinction rate ($\mu$).
Each variable is therefore assigned to two correlation coefficients, one for the correlation with $\lambda$ ($G_{\lambda, i}$, where $i$ is the index of the variable in the set of covariates) and the other for the correlation with $\mu$ ($G_{\mu, i}$).
An MCMC algorithm jointly estimates baseline origination and extinction rates and all the $G_{\lambda}$ and $G_{\mu}$, while controlling for over-parameterization.
Each $G_{\lambda,i}$ and $G_{\mu,i}$ is assigned a shrinkage weight ($w(G_{\lambda,i})$ or $w(G_{\mu,i})$), ranging between 0 and 1, testing its significance -- hence, the significance of the correlation itself.
A correlation of coefficient $G_{\lambda, 1}$ is considered significant if $w(G_{\lambda, 1}) > 0.5$ and if a sufficiently high proportion of its posterior density does not overlap with 0.
We selected seven abiotic and one biotic variable that appeared relevant to our case study (**Tab. S2**).
The abiotic variables included two global and four local-scale ones.
Temperature is known for being a major actor in the diversification of a wide range of clades [*e.g*., @condamine_assessing_2019].
Hence, we included in our model the average Cenozoic temperature dataset assembled by ref. @boschman_mountain_2022, using atmospheric $\delta^{18}O$ and $\delta^{13}C$ records from ref. @westerhold_astronomically_2020.
In addition, as they are expected to play a key role in habitat fragmentation on macroevolutionary scales, we added global sea level trends @miller_cenozoic_2020 and the average Andean uplift @boschman_andean_2021.
We also added the Neotropical plant diversity dataset assembled @jaramillo_cenozoic_2006.
Last, there is a debate regarding the role of land opening in shaping the evolution of SAM faunas, notably among herbivores.
We therefore included two regional proxies for land opening: Patagonian patterns of relative abundance of open habitats [@solorzano_evolutionary_2021; @stromberg_decoupling_2013; @palazzesi_fossil_2012] and Patagonian relative leaf area index @dunn_linked_2015.
Each abiotic correlate was subsampled or interpolated to a 500 ky time step.
In addition, we tested for diversity-dependence effects that could either come from the diversity of the tested clade itself (self-diversity, `-rmDD 0` option) or other clades (allowing to hypothesize possible inter-clade interactions).
As we expected environmental dissimilarities between the Eocene and the Oligocene at the continent scale, especially in high latitudes (where most of our occurrences come from), we did not expect Eocene and Oligocene faunas to have the same environmental constraints.
That is why, in addition to searching for environment signature in the diversification pattern across all our study period, we also decoupled trends among post-early Eocene Climate Optimum Eocene faunas (51--33.9 Ma), and Oligocene faunas (33.9--23.03 Ma).
Each MBD model was run across 10,000,000 iterations, sampling every 10,000.
We only carried out exponential correlations (`-m 0` option).
Convergence of the parameters was assessed using the pymc 5.9.2 Python library @wiecki_pymc-devspymc_2023, and parameters were considered convergent if their ESS were greater than 200.
A summary of our entire methodological pipeline is provided in **Fig.S2**.

### Considering the reliability of crowdsourced data

Over the past few decades, massive efforts have been devoted toward centralizing all published fossil data into large databases (*e.g*., <https://nowdatabase.org/>, <https://paleobiodb.org/>, <https://www.neotomadb.org/>).
Such an amount of easily-accessible data provided the invaluable opportunity for scientists to investigate large-scale patterns and processes of biodiversity using fossils, the only direct evidence of life in the past.
In our case, our primary source of data came from The Paleobiology Database (<https://paleobiodb.org/>).
However, we spotted many errors in the raw data, mostly regarding occurrences’ age or taxonomic name (typos, unaccounted synonymies, missing open nomenclature elements, etc.).
Most of these errors could not have been detected, and further corrected, without the authors’ prior knowledge on the group (see **Fig. S2** and **S4**).
The need for occurrence data revision was already illustrated by ref. @moharrek2022diversification, who pointed out significant differences when carrying out diversification analyses from uncleaned and cleaned occurrence data.
Therefore, we argue that although powerful statistical tools exist, tackling macroevolutionary issues cannot be done without preliminary biological knowledge on the focal group.


## 2. Manual cleaning details

In this part, we provide some details on the Paleogene fossil occurrence cleaning effort we carried out. All co-authors were involved in this part, and some changes have not been documented. Our raw and final datasets can be found attached with this manuscript. Computer-supervised cleaning steps are documented in our GitHub repository (<https://github.com/Buffan3369/Neotropical_mammals.git>).

The age ranges of the occurrences belonging to the Paso del Sapo fauna (Western Patagonia, *"Sapoan fauna"* SALMA) were set close to the Ypresian--Lutetian boundary. More precisely, occurrences from the *La Barda* or the *Laguna fría* localities were respectively set to 45-47 Ma and 48-49 Ma [@tejedor2009].    
Occurrences assigned to the former *Casamayoran* SALMA were re-assigned to a Middle Eocene age (37.71-47.8 Ma), except when more precision was provided in subsequent studies (*i.e.,* radiochronological dating)

We downloaded our data on The Paleobiology Database (<https://paleobiodb.org/>). We made sure to match each occurrences’ time range with the boundaries of its corresponding interval, either being a geological stage/epoch (55% of our occurrences) or a South American Land Mammal Age (SALMA) (45% of our occurrences). Then, we cleaned the data, verifying for each occurrence its age range, taxonomic name (correcting synonyms), restoring missing elements of open nomenclature (*eg*., “?”, “cf.”, “aff.”), removing duplicates and adding eventually newly-published data (1). Afterwards, occurrences associated to a SALMA were either binned to their corresponding sub-Epoch (‘SALMA smoothed to Sub-Epoch’) @figs1 or left as they were (‘SALMA kept’) (2). We also both analyzed diversification patterns at the species and the genus level (3). Several subsettings were tested, considering (i) full data, (ii) data without singletons, (iii) spatially scaled data, (iv) tropical partitioning and (v) “diet” (based on dental ecomorphotype). Once subsetted, each individual occurrence dataset was used as an input for our diversity inference accounting for preservation (4). Then, we proceeded to the diversification inference, either by (5) fitting birth-death models with constrained rate shifts (BDCS) (6) and model-estimated rate shifts (RJMCMC) (7) or by fitting environment-dependent multivariate birth-death models (MBD) (8). Last, we fitted an age-dependent extinction (ADE) model to our occurrence data within two time frames with constant extinction rate (9).

We displayed the ESS of the model posterior probability for all the 20 replicates we ran (A). ESS greater than 200 (first-scale indicator of a run that converged, $n=11$) are displayed in green. The proportion of origination and extinction times (resp. $T_S$ and $T_E$) that converged (*i.e*., with ESS > 200) are shown in, for each of our 20 replicates (B). The plot (C) is artefactual as it shows the posterior estimates of the mean death age of our group, together with their lower and upper boundaries of the 95% HPD interval. However, we excluded on purpose the occurrences older that 60 My.

However, in the case of the "late" dataset, the upper boundary of the 95% HPD is almost equal to one, and one is not included in the 90% HPD of the parameter, meaning that at least 90% of the distribution differs from one, which we judge large enough to claim for a significant effect of genus age on its extinction probability.
